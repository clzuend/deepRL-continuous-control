# Project 2 - Continuous Control - Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree

### Introduction

In this project, we use deep reinforcement learning (specifically variations of DQN) to train an agent to control a double-jointed arm.

### Setup

#### Download and install deepRL-navigation
```
clone git https://github.com/clzuend/deepRL-continuous-control.git
cd deepRL-continuous-control
pip install .
```

#### Download the Unity Reacher Environment
1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
2. Place the file in the project folder. 

3. Depending on your operating system you might have to change the ``REACHER_PATH`` in  `Continuous_Control.ipynb`. 

### Instructions

Open the `Continuous_Control.ipynb` workbook to initiate the environment and train the agents.
